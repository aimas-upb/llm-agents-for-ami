# AmI HMAS: LLM powered agents in a Hypermedia MAS, focused on Ambient Intelligence Applications.

This is the EUMAS 2025 demonstrator project for the deployment of the AmI HMAS agent system on a simulated smart environment environment deployed using the [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/Interactions-HSG/yggdrasil) platform.

Note that the demonstrator setup is split per branches in this repository:
- Yggdrasil Deployment with the simulated Lab308 smart lab environment --> branch [lab308](https://github.com/aimas-upb/llm-agents-for-ami/tree/lab308)
- Eclipse LMOS agent deployment for the `UserAssistant` agent --> branch [UserAssistantAgent](https://github.com/aimas-upb/llm-agents-for-ami/tree/UserAssistantAgent)
- Eclipse LMOS agent deployment for the `EnvMonitor` agent --> branch [EnvMonitor](https://github.com/aimas-upb/llm-agents-for-ami/tree/EnvMonitor)
- Eclipse LMOS agent deployment for the `EnvExplorer` agent --> branch [EnvExplorer](https://github.com/aimas-upb/llm-agents-for-ami/tree/EnvExplorer)
- Eclipse LMOS agent deployment for the `InteractionSolver` agent --> branch [InteractionSolver](https://github.com/aimas-upb/llm-agents-for-ami/tree/InteractionSolver)

Follow README indications in each branch to deploy the environment and the agents.
